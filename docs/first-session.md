- Here's a summary of what we've achieved:
  
  We've created a comprehensive Freeplane automation framework using Python, which allows programmatic control of the Freeplane mind mapping software through keyboard shortcuts. The framework consists of:  
- A complete command library (`freeplane-commands.py`): Contains functions for every Freeplane operation mapped to keyboard shortcuts, including file management, node creation and editing, formatting, navigation, and more.
- A command reference document: Provides a clear table showing each Freeplane command, its keyboard shortcut, and the corresponding Python function in our library.
- Robust window management: The system can reliably find and focus Freeplane windows, select the correct map tab, and handle the creation of new maps.
- Human-like typing simulation: Includes realistic typing with random delays between characters.
- Proper logging: Uses Python's logging module for clear feedback during automation.
- A demo function: Shows how to combine commands to create a simple mind map from scratch.
  
  Key challenges we solved:  
- Finding and focusing the correct Freeplane window using xdotool
- Ensuring focus shifts to newly created maps
- Handling the default "New Mindmap" text in new maps
- Creating a realistic typing experience
  
  This framework provides a foundation for more complex Freeplane automation scripts and can be easily extended with additional functionality as needed.
